# Housing Market Analysis

## Project Description
"Housing Market Analysis" is a brief analysis of the current housing market. This project aims to compare median housing sale prices, real mean personal income, and fixed 30-year mortgage rates over time. It also calculates the median monthly mortgage payment (assuming a 10% down payment on the median housing sale price with a 30-year mortgage) and the ratio of the median monthly mortgage payment to real mean monthly personal income. This analysis is inspired by an article from The Economist: ["Markets think interest rates could stay high for a decade or more"](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/11/02/markets-think-interest-rates-could-stay-high-for-a-decade-or-more).
